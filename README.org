* Weblorg Template

This template was created to help you quickly build your own website/blog with weblorg

** Getting Starter
Just create a repository using this template and start writing your posts and pages.

** Development environment
To develop your website/blog run this command:
#+begin_src shell-script
  $ ./unicorn.sh

This tools will watch files changes on =src= directory and will compile after any changes.

You need to configure production URL on [[./publish.el][publish.el]]

If you want to use Github pages don't forget to configure to use =docs= folder as your page content
